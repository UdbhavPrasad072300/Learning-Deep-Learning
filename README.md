# Learning Deep Learning & Big Data

## <b>Constantly being upgraded</b>

The collection of my Notes on: 
1) Deep Learning in PyTorch/TensorFlow
2) Big Data through Apache Spark

Deep Learning contains:
1) <b>Templates</b>: Code that can be used to create pipelines faster and easier without having to type out everything
2) <b>Examples</b>: Examples of fully functioning pipelines
3) <b>Info</b>: A summation of/from Notes that are important (a Cheatsheet) 
4) <b>Notes</b>: A collection of ntoes gathered from reading books, watching tutorials, etc.

Apache Spark contains:
1) Test.ipynb to initalize and test if spark contexts, sparkSQL and are working properly (these are useful when running Spark locally on your machine rather than on Cloud)
